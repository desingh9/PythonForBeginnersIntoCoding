### Triangles

1. **Easiest**

    Print one asterisk to the console.

    Example:
    ```
    *
    ```
3. **Draw a vertical line**

    Given a number n, print n lines, each with one asterisks.
    
    Example when n=3:
    ```
    *
    *
    *
    ```

4. **Draw a right triangle**

    Given a number n, print n lines, each with one more asterisk than the last (i.e. one on the first line, two on the second,etc.) 
    
    Example when n=3:
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ```

### Diamonds

5. **Isosceles triangle**

    Given a number n, print a centered triangle. 
    
    Example for n=3:
    ```
      *
     ***
    *****
    ```

6. **Diamond**

    Given a number n, print a centered diamond. 
    
    Example for n=3:
    
    ```
      *
     ***
    *****
     ***
      *
    ```


7. ### FizzBuzz
    FizzBuzz is a simple number game where you count, but say "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" instead of numbers adhering to certain rules.

    Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100.
    Instead of numbers divisible by three print "Fizz".
    Instead of numbers divisible by five print "Buzz".
    Instead of numbers divisible by three and five print "FizzBuzz".

        Sample Output:
        ```
        1
        2
        Fizz
        4
        Buzz
        Fizz
        7
        8
        Fizz
        Buzz
        11
        Fizz
        13
        14
        FizzBuzz
        ```

8. ### Prime Factors
        Write a method generate(int n) that given an integer N will return a list of integers such that the numbers are the factors of N and are arranged in increasing     numerical order.
        For example, generate(1) should return an empty list and generate(30) should return the numbers: 2,3,5.


9. Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered through the keyboard.

10. Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another.

11. Write a program to print all the ASCII values and their equivalent characters using a while loop. The ASCII values vary from 0 to 255.

12. Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called      an Armstrong number. For example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

13. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered.

14. Write a program to find the range of a set of numbers. Range is the difference between the smallest and biggest number in the list.
