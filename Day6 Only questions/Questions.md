## **IF-ELIF-ELSE Construct Questions**

1.	Ask user to enter age, sex ( M or F ), marital status ( Y or N ) and then using following rules print their place of service. 
<br> if employee is female, then she will work only in urban areas. 
<br> if employee is a male and age is in between 20 to 40 then he may work in anywhere 
<br> if employee is male and age is in between 40 tO 60 then he will work in urban areas only. 
<br> And any other input of age should print "ERROR". 

2.	write a program to input amount from user and print minimum number of notes (Rs. 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1) 
required for the amount.Program to find minimum number of notes required for the given denomination.Logic to find minimum number of denomination for a given amount in C program.

3.	If cost price and selling price of an item is input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. 
    <br>           Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.

4.	Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. 
     <br>          A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

5.	Find the absolute value of a number entered through the keyboard without using any inbuilt function.

6.	Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the area of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter. 
     <br>For example, the area of the rectangle with length = 5 and breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter. *Hint*

7.	Given a point (x, y), write a program to find out if it lies on the x-axis, y-axis or at the origin, viz. (0, 0). 

8.	Given the coordinates (x, y) of a center of a circle and itâ€™s radius, write a program which will determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.<br>
for ex. center of circle(3,3) and radius is 4,now user input 0,0 as x,y
now program should till this 0,0 lies within circle or not
(Hint: can use a\*\*2  for squaring and  a\*\*0.5 for square root)

9.	A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions:
(i) Hardness must be greater than 50<br>
(ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7<br>
(iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600<br>
The grades are as follows:<br>
Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met<br>
Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met<br>
Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met<br>
Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met<br>
Grade is 6 if only one condition is met<br>
Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met<br>
Write a program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel.
under consideration and output the grade of the steel

10.	A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject:
(a) He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B.<br>
(b) If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B. However, he should get at least 45 percent in A.<br>
(c) If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify.<br>
(d) In all other cases he is declared to have failed.<br>
Write a program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student is as passed, failed, or is allowed to reappear in B.<br>
